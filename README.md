# Classroom_Generator

**Warning** - **Python 3.10** is required to run the program as expected.
To download Python 3.10, use - https://www.python.org/downloads/
To download the IDE (Pycharm recommended), use - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

1) In Pupils.py - Fill in the list of pupils. Each pupil has three attributes:
   * **Name** - Must be unique per pupil.
   * **Front row precedence** (True/False).
   * **List of other ('bad') pupils** that can't be seated together.
2) In Class_Generator.py - Run the program (Shift-Alt-F10 Win/Linux, Ctrl-Alt-R macOS).
3) Check the terminal for the results.

Example of the program output for 8 pupils (without any restrictions):
Pupil4 - Pupil5    Pupil8 - Pupil6    

Pupil1 - Pupil7    Pupil3 - Pupil2 

**Note** - The left-right seating has no value, the teacher can easily swap the pupils on the same table.
